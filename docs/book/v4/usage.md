# Usage

Version `4.x` of `dot-annotated-services` is the last version that uses [doctrine/annotations](https://github.com/doctrine/annotations) to parse and inject dependencies.

You can use it to:
- [Inject class dependencies](factories/service.md)
- [Inject entity repositories](factories/repository.md)
